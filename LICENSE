This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common
set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be
paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry
(to handle the lower-level functions).

 *
 * Part of Adafruit's GFX graphics library. Originally this class was
 * written to handle a range of color TFT displays connected via SPI,
 * but over time this library and some display-specific subclasses have
 * mutated to include some color OLEDs as well as parallel-interfaced
 * displays. The name's been kept for the sake of older code.
